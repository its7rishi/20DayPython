I woke up early in the morning. I went for a walk in the park near my house. My 
grandparents and parents also went with me to the park The sun was glowing in the
 morning sky. A lot of people were taking the morning walk. Many people were also 
doing exercises and some children were also there who were playing. There, I saw a 
yellow flower. It was smiling at me. I smiled back at it and said, “Hello, Good morning dear little flower!”
